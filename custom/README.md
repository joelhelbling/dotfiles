# Custom Scripts

This directory is a home for any scripts which address the needs of specific installed software (e.g. rvm, Java, etc).  It is not envisioned as a home for scripts containing sensitive information (API secret keys, etc).  Those should be placed in the `private` directory which is gitignored.
