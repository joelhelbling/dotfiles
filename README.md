DOTFILES ALL OVER THE PLACE
===========================

At this point these dotfiles support my consoles in MinGW (windows), Mac OSX and Ubuntu.  It also handles a couple of vim-related things, mainly so that I can keep my git clone of akitaonrails' vimfiles clean.

Eventually I will incorporate my dotfiles from Cygwin as well.  I want all my accustomed aliases to always be available in all of those environments so I don't have to think so much about which machine/platform I'm using.

I'm striving for modularity: don't know if you'd get any benefit from taking these dotfiles wholesale, but if you see something handy that you don't already have, grab it and have fun.
