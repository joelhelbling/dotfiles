# DOTFILES SIMMERED FOR OVER A DECADE

_Almost ready!_

These dotfiles support my consoles in Mac OSX and Ubuntu.  At one time they also supported MinGW/MsysGit (windows), and to some extend Cygwin, but I have not tested those for a long time.  I expect, in any event, that if I ever want a shell environment in windows I will prefer the Windows Subsystem for Linux and will use my Ubuntu configuration as a starting point.

The goal has been to have all my accustomed aliases available in all environments in which I work, so I don't have to think so much about which machine/platform I'm using.

I'm striving for _modularity_: don't know if you'd get any benefit from taking these dotfiles wholesale, but if you see something handy that you don't already have, grab it and have fun.
